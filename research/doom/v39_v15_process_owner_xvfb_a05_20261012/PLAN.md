# A05 observation-channel successor

A04 is preserved as a harness-observation STOP. A05 retains the same scoped process-recovery hypothesis and Xvfb/owner conditions while changing only child-process observation: backend readiness and arm records are append-only fsynced JSONL; child stdout and stderr are files, so stdout framing cannot abort the supervisor. A05 gets a fresh output leaf that must not exist before invocation.

One candidate invocation; no retries. PASS_METHOD_SCOPED requires all existing gates: actual V15 process backend readiness, independent key press and keymap-down before session-only SIGKILL, independent release and keymap-up, matching fsynced verified receipt, stopped owner thread, service exit 0 without force termination, and controlled Xvfb SIGTERM. Any harness or infrastructure problem is preserved as STOP and not retried under A05.

Scope remains process-owner input recovery only; no full CLI, game, model, physical input, or product-level success claim. Pillow and unused gui_suite remain import stubs; Xlib and owner implementation are real.
