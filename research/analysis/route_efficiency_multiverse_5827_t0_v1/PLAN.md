# Issue #5827 T0 - endpoint multiverse accounting

## H / T / D / C / U

- H: a preregistered calculator and independent auditor distinguish sensitivity within task-completion latency from trade-offs across distinct estimands, preserve every matched attempt and hard gates, and reject planted favorable-but-invalid analyses.
- T: one finite no-model fixture with five cohorts: stable-positive matched tasks across cold/warm phases, independently verified effects and distinct capture/delivery clocks; finite-censor completion bounds that reverse sign; a completion-versus-human-work trade-off; verified safe-stop; collateral-error control. Construction tests precede freeze. Then one candidate and one separately authored raw-only audit.
- D: PASS_METHOD_SCOPED only if all pairs stay in denominators; same-estimand bounds report HOLD_ROBUSTNESS_FOR_THAT_CLAIM on sign reversal; different estimands are a vector, not an averaged contradiction; safe termination is not completion; collateral fails safety; missing tokens HOLD rather than zero; capture/delivery stay distinct; auditor replays all rows and rejects five mutations. Otherwise preserve first failure/hold/stop; no retries.
- C: one fixed primary endpoint with transparent phase breakdown may suffice; an overlarge specification set can add noise or admit irrelevant alternatives.
- U: synthetic accounting only. Censor bounds are fixture assumptions, not probabilities. No live route, GUI, speed, token reduction, user benefit, or causal claim.

## Frozen rules

Primary is paired task-completion latency, guarded minus direct; negative means faster. Every matched pair remains in the denominator. A complete route has a singleton interval; a finite censored route has the fixture's explicit lower/upper interval; open safe-stop/noncompletion bounds yield HOLD with no complete-case estimate.

Lower/upper censor analyses are sensitivities of the same completion-latency estimand. Safe-termination time, model wait, human residual work, tokens, capture-to-effect and delivery-to-effect are separate estimands and never averaged or allowed to rescue/overturn an unrelated primary.

Correctness/effect and safety are independent gates. Safe stop is not completion; any collateral error fails the fixture safety gate; missing tokens yield HOLD_MISSING_DATA. Invalid variants are excluded, not treated as eligible curve members.

Freeze exact current main in FREEZE.json. Standard-library Python, finite deterministic data, no model/GUI/input/network experiment/user data.
Docker Desktop preferred but unavailable at intake: desktop-linux named pipe exists, yet read-only GET /_ping did not answer in the bounded probe. No restart/container action. Issue #5827 explicitly defines T0 as cheap CPU-only ledger checking; host-only execution is recorded, not mislabeled Docker.
