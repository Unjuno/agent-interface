# Sequential relay host API

These two Node.js ES modules expose the already exercised relay client and optional host instrumentation outside the research tree. They use only Node built-ins and launch an explicit command supplied by the caller. Copy `relay_client.mjs` and `relay_host.mjs` together to use them outside a checkout. They are separate host files, not Python zipapp entries, and require Node.js 22 or newer. The execution relay can be the portable Python archive; see [public MCP transport](../cli_v1/MCP.md).

```js
import { createInstrumentedRelayClient } from './relay_host.mjs';
const client = await createInstrumentedRelayClient({
  command: '/absolute/python',
  args: ['/absolute/runtime.pyz', 'relay', '--',
    '--targets', '/absolute/targets.json',
    '--output-directory', '/absolute/new-server-records',
    '--session-mode', 'persistent-x11', '--display', ':99'],
  evidenceDirectory: '/absolute/new-host-records',
  reuseReviewedImages: false,
});
const response = await client.send('interface_observe', {
  target: 'editor', frame: 'screen_physical_px', region: [0, 0, 800, 600],
});
await client.present(response.attempt, {
  text: async value => { /* deliver metadata to the primary agent */ },
  image: async ({ bytes, mimeType }) => { /* deliver the same reply image */ },
});
// After actually reviewing the delivered image:
await client.review(response.attempt, {
  task: 'edit', phase: 'observe', reason: 'Describe the state actually reviewed',
});
// Use explicit per-call response bindings; do not review mutable latest state.
// Before EOF, send interface_close and inspect its release/cleanup outcome.
const closed = await client.send('interface_close', {});
await client.present(closed.attempt, { text: async value => {}, image: async value => {} });
await client.close();
```

The callback bodies above must be implemented by the host; empty callbacks do not constitute observation or review. The API does not supply a model, select actions, mint authority, install sensors, queue calls, restart applications or retry input. It returns metadata and the tool's image unchanged. A review receipt records attribution, not proof of perception or semantic completion.

`send` permits one outstanding call. If a host observation times out, await `wait()` on that same client; do not send again or create another client to replay it. Requests and replies are retained before delivery. Files are exclusive writes in a fresh directory; this is not fsync-backed crash durability or authenticated evidence. Ambiguous tool delivery, malformed replies or host-journal errors require reconciliation. `close()` ends the transport only and does not prove application cleanup. Separate caller-owned cleanup may still be needed.

Optional `reuseReviewedImages: true` references only a byte-identical PNG previously delivered and explicitly reviewed within this live host. Current metadata remains separate; identical pixels do not acknowledge task completion. Default false preserves full image delivery. Host timestamps partition transport/presentation/caller intervals; they do not measure isolated model reasoning, useful feedback, actual tokens/cost or human tempo.

Run `node --test runtime/host_v1/test_*.mjs`. The original research modules and frozen evidence remain unchanged; promotion changes only the local import paths. No performance or generic task-quality improvement is claimed.
